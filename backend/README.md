# Mesa de Ayuda - PHP Backend

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

The `vendor/autoload.php` file is generated by **Composer** (PHP's dependency manager). You need to install dependencies first:

```bash
cd backend
composer install
```

This will:
- Download all required PHP packages (JWT, PHPMailer, dotenv)
- Generate the `vendor/` directory with `autoload.php`
- Set up autoloading for the application classes

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
./start-php.sh
# Or: php -S localhost:3000 index.php
```

### 4. Test the API

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## What is vendor/autoload.php?

The `vendor/autoload.php` file is automatically generated by Composer and:
- **Loads all PHP dependencies** (packages from composer.json)
- **Enables class autoloading** (automatically loads classes when needed)
- **Is git-ignored** (not committed to version control)

This is similar to `node_modules` in Node.js - you need to run `npm install` to create it, and here you run `composer install`.

## Need Composer?

If you don't have Composer installed:

**Windows:**
Download from https://getcomposer.org/download/

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

## Full Documentation

See [README-PHP.md](./README-PHP.md) for complete documentation including:
- Server configuration (Apache/Nginx)
- API endpoints
- Security features
- Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Error: "vendor/autoload.php not found"
**Solution:** Run `composer install` in the backend directory

### Error: "composer: command not found"
**Solution:** Install Composer from https://getcomposer.org/

### Error: Database connection failed
**Solution:** Configure your `.env` file with correct database credentials
